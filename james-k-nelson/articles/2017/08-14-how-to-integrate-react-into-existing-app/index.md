Integrating React into an existing application is surprisingly simple. In many cases, it is actually simpler than starting from scratch. Seriously.

## Loading React

While you'd be forgiven for thinking that React can only be used along with npm, Webpack, and an assortment of other tooling, the truth is that React doesn't need any of this. **React works great by itself.**

You can actually import React into any page on your application with two simple `<script />` tags. Just as you'd import jQuery.

<Aside>
<Details>

This snippet loads React from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/#/), a CDN that lets you load NPM packages as `<script />` tags.

</Details>
</Aside>

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.4.1/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.4.1/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
```

## Designing components

In a typical React app, your entire page's content will be rendered by a single top-level component. For example, apps generated by create-react-app will have a top-level `<App />` component.

<img alt="Top-level structure" src={require("./full-structure.png")} />

But when using React within an existing application, you'll probably only want React to handle specific parts of each page.

<img alt="React in existing app" src={require("./existing-structure.png")} />

In fact, both of these layouts can be implemented using exactly the same function: `ReactDOM.render()`

## Starting React

The `ReactDOM.render()` function is how you *start* React. More specifically, it let's you add a [React Component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html) to an existing [DOM node](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24974621/what-is-a-node-in-javascript).

In a typical React app with a top-level `<App />` element, the application will be started by rendering `<App />` to a HTML element that is styled to take up the entire viewport.

<Aside>
<Details>

This example is taken from create-react-app. [See the original source](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/93029f8368f346bc97a12a3d2d9b0b13d8c5a713/packages/react-scripts/template/src/index.js#L7) on GitHub.

</Details>
</Aside>

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Of course, React doesn't limit you to rendering a single component that takes up the entire screen. It let's you render as many components as you like, to whichever nodes you like.

For example, you could render a `<SignUpForm pitch='Join the party!' />` element to the `#sidebar` div, and a `<Chart data={data} />` element to `#chart1`:

<Aside>
<Details>

Make sure that you don't run this script until the elements with ids `sidebar` and `chart1` exist! If it helps, you can call `ReactDOM.render()` from a `window.onload` handler.

</Details>
</Aside>

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <SignUpForm title='Join the party!' />,
  document.getElementById('sidebar')
);

const data = [[1, 0.1], [2, 0.5], [3, 0.3]];
ReactDOM.render(
  <Chart data={data} />,
  document.getElementById('chart1')
);
```

Did you notice how the `data` prop in the above example is just defined as a normal variable? Keep in mind that React code is Just JavaScript, and `ReactDOM.render()` is just a JavaScript function.

Once you've rendered a React Element to a DOM node, React will be in charge of managing that node's children. If the component's state changes due to an event, a network call, a Redux action, or any other reason, React will automatically update the DOM.

But what if you want to make some changes to the rendered element from the outside?

## Don't touch React markup

If you start modifying the DOM manually, React will lose track of the current state of the world, and will start doing funny things. If your application is important, these funny things will make you cry.

**Do not manually change DOM nodes that were rendered by React.**

Of course, your application can still communicate with your React components; you'll just need to do so by passing in new `props` to your React Elements with `ReactDOM.render()`. For example:

For more details on `ReactDOM.render()`, you can see my lesson on [How `ReactDOM.render()` works](/courses/react-fundamentals/how-react-works/reactdom-render/).

</Details>
</Aside>

```js
// The first call to `ReactDOM.render()` creates appropriate DOM nodes
ReactDOM.render(
  <Chart data={[[1, 0.1], [2, 0.5], [3, 0.3]]} />,
  document.getElementById('chart1')
);

// The second call to `ReactDOM.render()` just updates the props
ReactDOM.render(
  <Chart data={[[1, 0.1], [2, 0.5], [3, 0.3], [4, 0.2]]} />,
  document.getElementById('chart1')
);
```

You can even pass in callback functions as props, allowing your components to communicate with your existing application code.

## What about JSX?

<Aside>
<Details>

If your app *is* using Babel already, you'll just need to add the [appropriate preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react) to your `.babelrc`.

</Details>
</Aside>

Your browser doesn't understand JSX. It only understand vanilla JavaScript. And if you're not using Babel or Webpack to compile your existing JavaScript code, you won't be able to use JSX.

Luckily, **you don't need to use JSX.**

The thing about JSX is it is just a shorthand way of writing `React.createElement()`. If your application doesn't use Babel, you can still manually write out `React.createElement()`.

For example, here is the above code example, but with JSX elements converted into `React.createElement()` calls:

<Aside>
<Details>

See how JSX maps to JavaScript in [The 6 rules of JSX: a live cheatsheet](/toolbox/jsx-live-cheatsheet/).

</Details>
</Aside>

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(SignUpForm, { title: 'Join the party!' }),
  document.getElementById('sidebar')
);

const data = [[1, 0.1], [2, 0.5], [3, 0.3]]
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Chart, { data: data }),
  document.getElementById('chart1')
);
```

Of course, even if you haven't got a build system, you can still use JSX! You'll just need to make sure you compile it to JavaScript before it hits the browser.

The best way to build JSX into JavaScript this will depend on the platform you're using. But you'll always have the option of using a [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)-based build system and plonking the output JavaScript files in your `public` directory. After all, **React is just JavaScript.**

## TL;DR

React *can* be integrated into an existing application. Just remember:

- Render individual components, not an entire application.
- React is in charge of React's markup. Don't touch it.
- `ReactDOM.render()` adds your elements to a DOM node, and can also update their props.
- Your components can communicate with your app via callbacks.
- Don't use JSX in code that is sent to the browser.
