This lesson is based on the effects lesson in my [React, Firebase & Bacon](/bacon/) course.

</Doc.Details>

Imagine that for some reason, you've decided to create a React component that renders an animated fractal tree. In fact, let's say that you're already 90% of the way there -- you *have* a fractal tree component, and now you want to animate it.

```js
//--- App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import FractalTreeFrame from './FractalTreeFrame'

// The height and width of the entire window
const { innerHeight, innerWidth } = window

export default function App() {
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({
    x: innerWidth / 2,
    y: innerHeight / 2,
  })

  return (
    <FractalTreeFrame
      mousePosition={mousePosition}
      onMouseMove={({ clientX: x, clientY: y }) =>
        setMousePosition({ x, y })
      }
      time={Date.now()}
    />
  )
}
//--- FractalTreeFrame.js <-- FractalTree.js
//--- FractalHelpers.js <-- FractalHelpers.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
```

If you move the mouse around the preview area, you'll see that the tree is *already* somewhat animated, due to the `onMouseMove` handler:

```jsx
onMouseMove={({ clientX: x, clientY: y }) =>
  setMousePosition({ x, y })
}
```

Each time the mouse moves over the preview area, React calls this event handler. This in turn updates the component state, triggering a re-render of the component with a new value of the `time` prop.

```jsx
time={Date.now()}
```

<Doc.AsideTop>

Of course, it won't do to require the user to constantly move their mouse to keep the animation going. Ideally, the component would *automatically* schedule a new frame after each frame is rendered, using something like the browser's `requestAnimationFrame()` function.

<Doc.Details aside>

`requestAnimationFrame()` requests that the browser calls a specified function before the next repaint -- allowing you to render an animation one frame at a time. For more details, [see MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame).

</Doc.Details>
</Doc.AsideTop>

As it happens, there's a pretty obvious way to make this work. Given that updating the state also triggers a re-render, you can store the current time with a `useState` hook. Then, you can trigger re-render by updating the time in a `requestAnimationFrame()` callback. To try it out, just uncomment lines 14-17 below:

```js
//--- App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import FractalTreeFrame from './FractalTreeFrame'

// The height and width of the entire window
const { innerHeight, innerWidth } = window

export default function App() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(Date.now())
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({
    x: innerWidth / 2,
    y: innerHeight / 2,
  })

  // window.requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  //   // Update time to trigger a re-render
  //   setTime(Date.now())
  // })

  return (
    <FractalTreeFrame
      mousePosition={mousePosition}
      onMouseMove={({ clientX: x, clientY: y }) =>
        setMousePosition({ x, y })
      }
      time={time}
    />
  )
}
//--- FractalTreeFrame.js <-- FractalTree.js
//--- FractalHelpers.js <-- FractalHelpers.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
```

Once you've removed the comment above, this animation looks to work pretty well! That is, at least until you try moving the mouse over the tree as well. Go ahead, try quickly moving your mouse over the tree, and see how performance takes a nosedive.

*What the hell is going on?*

Here's the problem: if the mouse moves, then React will update the state and re-render the component, thus scheduling *another* render in addition to the one already scheduled by `requestAnimationFrame()`. Now you have *two* scheduled renders, twice the CPU usage, half the frame rate, and everything starts to grind to a halt.


## So... effects?

In the above example, the call to `window.requestAnimationFrame()` is what's called a **side effect**; it's something that your component does *in addition* to returning elements.

Side effects are what make your application *actually useful*. They're responsible for things like:

- Loading data from the server
- Setting and clearing timers
- Interacting with the DOM

<Doc.AsideTop>

As you can see from the above example, it's entirely possible to put effectful code directly in the component function. The thing is, the resulting effects occur *each and every* time the component function is called -- which is rarely the desired behavior. More often, you'll want the effect to occur in response to specific conditions -- and to *stop* occurring once those conditions are removed.

<Doc.Details aside>

When using features like [React Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense), it's possible for component functions to be stopped mid-execution, and repeated later on. This can result in parts of the function being run multiple times, or not being run at all.

</Doc.Details>
</Doc.AsideTop>


The `useEffect()` function
--------------------------

This hook function lets you ask React to do something *after* the component has finished rendering to the DOM. There are a few ways to use it, so let's start with the simplest:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // do stuff after update
})
```

When `useEffect()` receives a function as its first and only argument, it'll call that function on *every* update. You might use this to, for example, validate usernames in a social network's onboarding sequence. You can see how I've approached this below -- go ahead, try typing in a username to test it out!

```js
//---
persistenceKey: effects-username-availability
theme: light
//--- App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import getUsernameAvailability from './getUsernameAvailability'

export default function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('')
  const [availability, setAvailability] = useState({})
  const handleChange = event => setUsername(event.target.value)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (username && username !== availability.username) {
      // The promises returned by getUsernameAvailability
      // will always resolve in the same order as they're created,
      // so we don't have to worry about race conditions here.
      getUsernameAvailability(username).then(
        isAvailable => setAvailability({ username, isAvailable })
      )
    }
  })

  return (
    <div className="nametag">
      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <label>
        <p>my username is</p>
        <div className="field">
          <span className="at">@</span>
          <input value={username} onChange={handleChange} />
          <span className="icon">
            {username && availability.username === username && (
              availability.isAvailable ? "✔️" : "❌"
            )}
          </span>
        </div>
      </label>
    </div>
  )
}
//--- getUsernameAvailability.js <-- getUsernameAvailability.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
//--- index.js <-- index.js
```

<Doc.Details aside>

Want to know more about Promise objects, like the one in the above example? Check out my [Mastering Async JavaScript](/courses/async-javascript) course for a detailed introduction.

</Doc.Details>

In the above example, the effect starts by checking whether validation still needs to be performed for the current username. Then, if validation *is* still required, it calls `getUsernameAvailability()` and saves the result to component state.

While it may seem like a minor (and imperfect) optimization, the `if` statement inside the above effect is actually *incredibly* important. Do you know why?

<Doc.Spoiler>

Without the `if` statement, you get an infinite loop.

</Doc.Spoiler>

Saving the validation result to component state triggers another update, which triggers the effect, which triggers the update, which... yeah, you get the idea. 

Effects often need to update component state, and this presents a bit of a problem: if you run these effects in response to *every* update, you can easily end up with infinite loops. Typically though, you *don't want* to run effects in response to every update. You only want them to respond to specific events -- and that's where the second argument of `useEffect()` comes in.


Conditional effects
-------------------

The second argument to `useEffect()` -- called the **dependencies array** -- instructs React to **only run the effect if a dependency has changed from its previous value**.

<Doc.AsideTop>

```js
useEffect(
  () => {
    // do stuff after specified updates
  },
  [executeWhenThisChanges, orWhenThisChanges]
)
```

<Doc.Details aside title="Empty arrays">

If you pass an empty array `[]` for the dependencies, the effect will only run once -- on mount.

</Doc.Details>
</Doc.AsideTop>

The dependencies array gives you a simple way to create effects that respond to specific events, *without* running into infinite loops. And with that in mind, let's revisit the username example with an exercise.

**Your task is to refactor the below example with a dependencies array, so that it no longer uses an `if` statement.**

Be careful to add the dependencies array *before* removing the `if` statement though -- otherwise you'll end up with an infinite loop!

```js
//---
persistenceKey: effects-username-conditional
//--- App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import getUsernameAvailability from './getUsernameAvailability'

export default function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('')
  const [availability, setAvailability] = useState({})
  const handleChange = event => setUsername(event.target.value)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (username && username !== availability.username) {
      // The promises returned by getUsernameAvailability
      // will always resolve in the same order as they're created,
      // so we don't have to worry about race conditions here.
      getUsernameAvailability(username).then(
        isAvailable => setAvailability({ username, isAvailable })
      )
    }
  })

  return (
    <div className="nametag">
      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <label>
        <p>my username is</p>
        <div className="field">
          <span className="at">@</span>
          <input value={username} onChange={handleChange} />
          <span className="icon">
            {username && availability.username === username && (
              availability.isAvailable ? "✔️" : "❌"
            )}
          </span>
        </div>
      </label>
    </div>
  )
}
//--- solution:App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import getUsernameAvailability from './getUsernameAvailability'

export default function App() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('')
  const [availability, setAvailability] = useState({})
  const handleChange = event => setUsername(event.target.value)

  // Because this effect supplies [username] as a second argument,
  // it'll only run after updates where `username` has changed value.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (username) {
      getUsernameAvailability(username).then(
        isAvailable => setAvailability({ username, isAvailable })
      )
    }
  }, [username])

  return (
    <div className="nametag">
      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <label>
        <p>my username is</p>
        <div className="field">
          <span className="at">@</span>
          <input value={username} onChange={handleChange} />
          <span className="icon">
            {username && availability.username === username && (
              availability.isAvailable ? "✔️" : "❌"
            )}
          </span>
        </div>
      </label>
    </div>
  )
}
//--- getUsernameAvailability.js <-- getUsernameAvailability.js
//--- styles.css <-- styles.css
//--- index.js <-- index.js
```

Did you have a go? Great! In that case, if you take a look at the solution for the above exercise, you might notice something interesting. Here's the original:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (username !== availability.username) {
    // ...
  }
})
```

In contrast, here's the solution with a dependencies array:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (username) {
    // ...
  }
}, [username])
```

At first, there might not seem to really be any point in making this change. Sure, it saved you a couple characters... but if you look a little closer, there's something far more exciting going on. Do you know what it is? Have a little think about this before checking the box below.

<Doc.Spoiler>

Actually, there are two exciting things going on here!

First, there's the fact that the number of validations is cut in half -- you can confirm this by opening up the console in both of the above examples. This is because the effect is now only being run when the username has changed -- as opposed to running when it differs to the *last received username*. It gives you a better result, despite using less code. Which brings me to the second exciting thing.

While the condition in the first snippet references *two* variables: `username`, and `availability.username`, the second snippet *only needs the `username`*. By using the dependencies array, you've eliminated the need for an extra piece of state!

</Doc.Spoiler>

The key feature of `useEffect()` is that it lets you specify not just *what* effect to run, but also *when* that effect should occur -- and it lets you do this declaratively, without relying on component state at all! In fact, it actually takes this one step further: it lets you declare how the effect should *end*.


The cleanup function
--------------------

When you return a function from your `useEffect()` callback, React will call that function when the effect should no longer have any... effect. <small><em>lol, sorry not sorry.</em></small>

<Doc.AsideTop>

```js
useEffect(
  () => {
    // do stuff after specified updates

    return () => {
      // finish doing stuff
    }
  },
  [executeWhenThisChanges, orWhenThisChanges]
)
```

<Doc.Beware aside title="Effects and async">

The `useEffect()` hook does *not* allow you to pass in async callbacks. And when you think about it, this makes sense -- async functions always return a promise, which would make it impossible to return a cleanup function.

</Doc.Beware>
</Doc.AsideTop>

This function is often called the **cleanup function**, and there are *two* situations in which React will call it. Do you know what they are? Have a think about it, and when you're ready, check your answer below.

<Doc.Spoiler>

The cleanup function will be called:

1. When the component is unmounted
2. On the *next time* that the effect callback is run

</Doc.Spoiler>

The first of these situations is hopefully fairly obvious. But what about the second situation? *This is what makes the effect hook so powerful.* It lets you declare to React:

*Yo React, I want this thing to happen, but only* until *the next time it happens (or until it no longer* can *happen).*

The cleanup function is particularly important when dealing with data subscriptions -- I'll cover more on this in the routing section of [React, Firebase & Bacon](/bacon). For the moment though, let's jump back to where we started: the animated tree.

In order to smooth out the tree's animation, all you need to do is finish off the effect in the demo below. The thing is, there are actually *two* approaches that you can take. Do you know what they are? If so, try them out in the editor -- and then check below to find out which one works best.

```js
//---
persistenceKey: effects-smooth-animated-tree
//--- App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import FractalTreeFrame from './FractalTreeFrame'

// The height and width of the entire window
const { innerHeight, innerWidth } = window

export default function App() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(Date.now())
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({
    x: innerWidth / 2,
    y: innerHeight / 2,
  })

  // useEffect(() => {
  //   window.requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  //     // Update time to trigger a re-render
  //     setTime(Date.now())
  //   })
  // })

  return (
    <FractalTreeFrame
      mousePosition={mousePosition}
      onMouseMove={({ clientX: x, clientY: y }) =>
        setMousePosition({ x, y })
      }
      time={time}
    />
  )
}
//--- solution:App.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import FractalTreeFrame from './FractalTreeFrame'

// The height and width of the entire window
const { innerHeight, innerWidth } = window

export default function App() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(Date.now())
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = useState({
    x: innerWidth / 2,
    y: innerHeight / 2,
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    const frame = window.requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      // Update time to trigger a re-render
      setTime(Date.now())
    })
    return () => {
      window.cancelAnimationFrame(frame)
    }
  })

  return (
    <FractalTreeFrame
      mousePosition={mousePosition}
      onMouseMove={({ clientX: x, clientY: y }) =>
        setMousePosition({ x, y })
      }
      time={time}
    />
  )
}
//--- FractalTreeFrame.js <-- FractalTree.js
//--- FractalHelpers.js <-- FractalHelpers.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
```

Did you find both approaches?

<Doc.Spoiler>

##### Approach 1: conditional effects

Given that `time` is only updated within `requestAnimationFrame`, you can limit the number of renders by adding `time` as a dependency.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  window.requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    setTime(Date.now())
  })
}, [time])
```

So long as the tree is the top level component, this approach works fine and dandy. Be careful, though -- if this component is *not* at the top level and is then *unmounted* inside a running application, it would cause a warning, as `setTime` would still be called after unmount.


##### Approach 2: cleanup function

By calling [cancelAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/cancelAnimationFrame) in the cleanup function, you'll ensure that any scheduled updates are cancelled when you move the mouse.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const frame = window.requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    setTime(Date.now())
  })
  return () => {
    window.cancelAnimationFrame(frame)
  }
})
```

I'd recommend taking this approach, for two reasons:

1. It'll work just as well if you decide to update `time` elsewhere
2. It'll work just as well if the component is mounted elsewhere

</Doc.Spoiler>


## The three rules

Phew, that was a lot of info on effects! It's okay if you didn't take it all in -- as you keep using effects in your day-to-day (or in my [React, Firebase & Bacon](/course) course), you'll gradually build intuition for them. But to start with? All you need to remember is these three rules:

1. `useEffect()` schedules an update *after* the DOM has been updated
2. By passing a dependencies array, that updated will only occur if a dependency has changed
3. If you return a cleanup function, it'll be called when the effect should should no longer apply

Got these three rules in mind? Good. Let's see if we can't put 'em all into practice with an exercise.


## Exercise: debounce the username form

If you take a look at the console for this example, you'll see that as you type, a separate validation request is made for *each and every* keystroke. Given that at some level you're going to be charged per request... well, if your app grows large enough, a little debounce could save a lot of bacon.

But what do I mean by debouncing? Simple: instead of validating each and every keystroke, you'll want to delay validation until the user has stopped typing for a short period. Roughly speaking, here's how to achieve this:

1. When the user updates the input, you'll use [setTimeout()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) to schedule a validation to occur a few hundred milliseconds in the future.
2. If the user updates the input *again* before the previously scheduled validation has occurred, then cancel it with [clearTimeout()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearTimeout) before scheduling another one.

**Your task is to debounce the username input so that validation runs no more than once every 500ms.**

You can check your work by opening up the console, and watching how many requests are made as you type. Then, once you're happy with your work (or if you're stuck but you've given the exercise a solid try), compare your work with my solution by clicking the *solution* button at the bottom left.
