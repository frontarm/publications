## Asynchronous event handlers

<Doc.Details aside title="Prerequisites">

We'll be using JavaScript's `async`/`await` syntax in this lesson. If you need to brush up, head on over to my [Mastering Asynchronous JavaScript](/courses/async-javascript) course.

Imagine that you're building a <em>Vouch</em> button. You want it to call an API endpoint when the user clicks it, and you want to let the user know when the action has completed successfully.

Assuming your API endpoint returns a `Promise`, implementing this is surprisingly simple: just turn the event handler into an async function and `await` the result!

```jsx
//--- App.js
import React from 'react'
import VouchButton from './VouchButton'
import vouch from './vouch'

function App() {
  return (
    <VouchButton onClick={async () => {
      await vouch({ id: 'test' })
      alert(`You've vouched for "test".`)
    }}>
      Vouch
    </VouchButton>
  )
}

export default App
//--- vouch.js <-- vouch.js
//--- VouchButton.js <-- VouchButton.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
```

If it surprises you that this demo works, then you're not alone -- it surprised *me* when I first saw it too! But when you think about it for a bit, it actually makes a lot of sense.

As you probably know, React event handlers are just plain old functions -- and `async` functions are plain old functions too. The main difference between standard and `async` functions is that `async` functions always return a `Promise`. The thing is, React doesn't actually use the returned value anyway -- so whichever type of function you use, it all works fine and dandy.
