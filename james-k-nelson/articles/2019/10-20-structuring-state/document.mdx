Let's rewind to the exercise at the end of the previous lesson, where I asked you to add two `useStates` -- one each for `loading` and `error`. Remember how I then went on to merge them into the single `status` variable without explaining why?

```js
//--- App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import VouchButton from './VouchButton'
import vouch from './vouch'

function App() {
  let [status, setStatus] = useState({ type: 'ready' })

  return (
    <VouchButton
      busy={status.type === 'busy'}
      done={status.type === 'done'}
      tooltip={status.type === 'error' && status.message}
      onClick={async () => {
        setStatus({ type: 'busy' })

        try {
          await vouch({ id: 'test' })
          setStatus({ type: 'done' })
        }
        catch (error) {
          setStatus({
            type: 'error',
            message: error.message || 'Something went wrong',
          })
        }
      }}>
      Vouch
    </VouchButton>
  )
}

export default App
//--- vouch.js <-- vouch.js
//--- VouchButton.js <-- VouchButton.js
//--- index.js <-- index.js
```

With the counter example earlier on this page in mind, do you have an idea about why I merged `loading` and `error` into a single `status`? Have a think about it, and once you're ready, take a look at my reasoning in the box below.

<Doc.Spoiler>

As the `vouch()` function is asynchronous, calling both `setLoading()` and `setError()` after `vouch()` would result in a double render.

By merging the loading and error state into a single `status` variable, it becomes possible to update the state with just a *single* render.

</Doc.Spoiler>

Sure, this isn't going to result in any perceivable performance benefit *right now*, but it's worth getting into good habits early, right?

Incidentally, you'll see this pattern of flattened out state often enough that it's worth knowing the name for it: it's a **state machine**.

You've may have heard this term before -- perhaps in college, or maybe associated with overly complex libraries and tooling. Relax though, state machines are actually an incredibly simple idea. Here's the gist:

- A state machine holds all its state in a *single* variable. The state can be a string like `"busy"`, or an object like `{ type: "error", message: "Oh shit." }`.
- A state machine must only change state in response to external events -- like user interactions, timers, or a response from the server.
- A state machine with a given state will *always* respond to the same event in the same way.

If you've built a component that follows these rules -- just like the one above? Then congratulations! You've built a state machine! Due to the rules of state machines, you'll find it far easier to reason about your component's state, and thus to ensure that your component doesn't double render -- *even when using `async` functions.*

<TypeScriptHint>

If you're using TypeScript, then you can define the states of a state machine using union types. For example, here's how you'd type the states from the previous demo:

```typescript
type Status =
  | { type: 'ready' }
  | { type: 'busy' }
  | { type: 'error', message?: string }
  | { type: 'complete' }
```

</TypeScriptHint>

As it so happens, there's a class of state machine that is so popular within the React community that you've probably already heard of it: Redux-style **reducers**. React even provides a [useReducer()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) hook as an alternative to `useState()`, which I'll cover in more detail in a future lesson. But first -- we have a form to finish!
