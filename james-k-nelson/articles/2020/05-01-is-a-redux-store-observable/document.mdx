If you've been using JavaScript for a while, then you've probably heard of observables. They're at the core of [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/api/core/ObservableQuery/), [Angular JS](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library), and there's even a [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable) to add them to JavaScript itself.

Of course, for many people, the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word *observables* is the enormous [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) library. And because of this, it can seem like observables are big, complicated things. But in truth, they can be as simple as a plain object with a `subscribe` method.

```typescript
interface Observable<T> {
  subscribe(onNext: (value: T) => void): () => void
}
```

While slightly different to the RxJS Observable, the above interface accomplishes exactly the same thing. It says: an `Observable` is an object with a `subscribe()` method, that takes an `onNext(value)` callback, and returns a function (which can be used to cancel the subscription). Simple, right? In fact, if you've ever used a Redux store, you might have seen something similar.


Redux's Store
-------------

When you create a store using Redux's `createStore()` function, you'll get an object with a `subscribe()` method. In fact, this looks a lot like an Observable's `subscribe()` method -- but there's an important difference.

```typescript
interface ReduxStore {
  subscribe(onChange: () => void): () => void
}
```

Can you see what the difference is? Check your answer by clicking the spoiler below.

The callback that you pass to a Redux store's `subscribe()` method does not receive any arguments!

</Doc.Spoiler>

Where an observable's `subscribe()` function notifies you of each value *as it occurs*, Redux's subscribe function only tells you that *something* changed... *probably*. To find out *what* changed, you'll need to call another method on the `store` object: `getState()`.

```typescript
interface ReduxStore<T> {
  getState(): T
}
```


A trick question
----------------

Say that you have an observable, and you want to log every value that it produces to the console. Here's how you'd do it:

```typescript
observable.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log(value)
})
```

Makes sense, right? So the next question is: how would you log every state of a *Redux* store to the console? Let's do this as an exercise!

**Your task is is to log every state of the below store to the console.**

*Remember: you can get the current state with `store.getState()`.*

You may think that this exercise looks far too simple, but give it a try anyway -- you'll see why when you're done.

```js
//---
rightPanel: console
maximizeRightPanel: true
//--- index.js
import { store } from './store'

console.log('Your task: log each new store state to the console.')

store.subscribe(() => {
  // TODO
})

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  store.dispatch({ type: 'next' })
}
//--- store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux'

export const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  // console.log(state)

  switch (action.type) {
    case 'next':
      return state + 1

    default:
      return state
  }
}

export const store = createStore(reducer)

store.subscribe(() => { 
  if (store.getState() % 2 === 1) {
    store.dispatch({
      type: 'next',
    })
  }
})
```

How'd you go? Did you find something odd, where the console displayed every even number between 2 and 10 -- *twice*? Let me explain why.

<Doc.Spoiler>

While `index.js` only dispatches 5 actions, `store.js` also has a `subscribe()` handler -- and this one dispatches a second `next` action whenever the current state is an odd number.

```js
store.subscribe(() => { 
  if (store.getState() % 2 === 1) {
    store.dispatch({
      type: 'next',
    })
  }
})
```

</Doc.Spoiler>

## Sources

There's an important difference between Observables and Redux-like stores -- which I'm going to start calling **Sources**, and which I'm going to define as having a `getCurrentValue()` function in place of `getState()`.

```typescript
interface Source<T> {
  subscribe(onChange: () => void): () => void
  getCurrentValue(): T
}
```

While an Observable passes *every* value to *every* subscribe callback, a Source makes no such guarantee; it can *skip* values. This makes Sources less capable than Observables in some ways; for example, you can't `reduce` over a Source's values. Interestingly though, this limitation actually makes Sources a much better fit for building UIs with React, because it allows for an interesting possibility.

**What if there is *no* current value?**

What if `getCurrentValue()` throws an Error? What if it throws a Promise? *What if you pass a source that throws an Error or Promise to React's [useSubscription](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/use-subscription) hook?* **You'll get Suspense and Error Boundaries support without writing a single line of component or hook-based code.**

*Okay James, but what's your point?*

Let me be clear: I'm *not* suggesting you throw out Apollo Client and switch back to Redux -- after all, Redux's `getState()` can't throw promises. But it *is* [food for thought](https://github.com/jamesknelson/retil/tree/monorepo/packages/source).
