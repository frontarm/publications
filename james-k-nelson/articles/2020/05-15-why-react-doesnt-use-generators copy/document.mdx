- Generators are pretty darn cool.
- I've tried to make things with generators, and I'm not alone.
- Crank.js is a popular new library using them for components.
- But Crank.js has a problem: its components jam up.

```js
//--- index.js
/** @jsx createElement */
import {createElement} from "@bikeshaving/crank";
import {renderer} from "@bikeshaving/crank/dom";

function *Timer() {
  let seconds = 0;
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    seconds++;
    this.refresh();
  }, 1000);
  try {
    while (true) {
      yield <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
    }
  } finally {
    clearInterval(interval);
  }
}

renderer.render(<Timer />, document.body);
```

- What's going on here, and how is it that React manages to avoid this?

## What are generators?

So basically, generators are a neat way to implement Fibonacci generators in interviews

but let me backtrack and ask an entirely different question: what are async functions? they're functions, which output a promise to the value

generators are another type of function with a special output -- they output *iterators*.

  iterator interface

they have a special syntax, and a special `yield` operator which outputs the next value of the iterator, and can also return something passed in via `next()`

in fact, you can have async generators too, which outputs an async iterator. I won't cover the details on generators though; for that, use trusty mdn. the main thing to keep in mind, is that generators are functions which can output a sequence of values using `yield`. and this makes them perfect for defining components.


## ui components

when you think about it, components are also kinda like generators -- they output a sequence of elements.

---

They can store state in closures.

They can output elements via yield.

And unlike components, they can even await!

here's what it looks like in crank.js

```js

```

okay, so generators are a perfect fit for components. obviously, that means React has made a grave mistake by avoiding them. right?


## why's my async component jammed up?
